# This will run when:
# - a new release is created, and will attach the generated
#   artifacts to the release
# - when new code is pushed to master/develop to make sure the
#   code does compile.
# - when a pull request is created and updated to make sure the
#   code does compile.

# The jobs are chained, the first thing that is run is the code to
# update all the dependencies (which are cached). The cache is
# linked to the project/Build.scala file, if this changes the cache
# is invalidated.
# Once build is done it will start the test, dist and documentation
# phases (which are executed in parallel).
jobs:

  # downloads all the dependencies and compiles the scala code
