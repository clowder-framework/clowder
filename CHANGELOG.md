# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 1.12.1 - 2020-11-05

### Fixed
- Error uploading to spaces that did not have extractors enabled/disabled (personel spaces).
- If extractor does not have any parameters, there would be an error message in the console of the browser.
- If the extractor did not have a user_id it would create an error and not record the event.

### Changed
- Docker Images are now pushed to [github container registry](https://github.com/orgs/clowder-framework/packages)

## 1.12.0 - 2020-10-19
**_Warning:_**
- This update modifies the MongoDB schema. Make sure to start the application with `-DMONGOUPDATE=1`.
- This update modifies information stored in Elasticsearch used for text based searching. Make sure to initiate a reindex 
  of Elasticsearch from the Admin menu or by `POST /api/reindex`.

### Added
- Global extractors page now shows more information, including submission metrics, logs (using Graylog), job history and
  extractors maturity. Extractors can be grouped using labels. User can filter list of extractors by labels, space, trigger
  and metadata key.
- Users have more refined options to set extractors triggers at the space level. They can now follow global settings, 
  disable and enable triggers.
- Ability to set chunksize when downloading files. Set defult to 1MB from 8KB. This will result in faster downloads and 
  less CPU usage at the cost of slightly more memory use.
- Support for parsing of Date and Numeric data in new metadata fields. New search operators <, >, <=, >= have been 
  added to search API now that they can be compared properly.
- Track user_id with every extraction event. [#94](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/94)
- Added a new storage report at `GET api/reports/storage/spaces/:id` for auditing user storage usage on a space basis.
- The file and dataset metrics reports also have support for since and until ISO8601 date parameters.
- Added `viewer_hop` a 3D models previewer for `*.ply` and `*.nxz` files. Added `mimetype.nxz=model/nxz` and 
  `mimetype.NXZ=model/nxz` as new mimetypes in `conf/mimetypes.conf`

### Fixed
- Ignore the `update` field when posting to `/api/extractors`. [#89](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/89)
- Search results were hardcoded to be in batches of 2.
- Fixed permissions checks on search results for search interfaces that would cause misleading counts. [#60](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/60)

## 1.11.2 - 2020-10-13

### Fixed
- Clowder healthcheck was not correct, resulting in docker-compose never thinking it was healthy. This could also result 
  in traefik not setting up the routes. 

## 1.11.1 - 2020-09-29

### Added
- Added healtz endpoint that is cheap and quick to return, useful for kubernetes live/ready checks.

### Fixed

- Added MongoDB index for `folders.files`.

### Changed
- Updated update-clowder script to work with migration to github. Has the ability now to push a message to MSTEAMS as well as influxdb.

## 1.11.0 - 2020-08-31

### Added

- Script to clean extractors' tmp files `scripts/clean-extractors-tmpfiles/`.
- Script for RabbitMQ error queue cleanup `scripts/rmq-error-shovel/`.
- Ability to use HTML formatting in the welcome message on the home page. [#51](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/51)
- Expose a read-only list of extractors to all users.

### Changed
- Improved test script `scripts/tester/tester.sh` to report successes once a day.

### Fixed
- Escape colon characters on search values for search box and advanced search to allow those values in a search.
- Typesafe now only offers https access. [#49](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/49)
- If uploading files by url > 2147483647 it would fail. [#54](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder/issues/54)


## 1.10.1 - 2020-07-16

### Fixed
- Queue threads (e.g. Elasticsearch indexer) will no longer crash permanently if the queue connection to Mongo is lost temporarily.
- Docker images would not build correctly on GitHub.

## 1.8.2 - 2020-02-19

### Fixed
- Use the passed-in length within S3ByteStorageService.save.

## 1.8.1 - 2020-02-05

### Removed
- Removed unused RDF libraries. This was probably used by the rdf/xml functionality that was removed a while back but 
the dependencies were never removed.
- Removed Jena validation of JSON-LD metadata. It was creating a blank graph and clients couldn't upload metadata when 
Clowder runs in a location that doesn't not have access to https://clowderframework.org/contexts/metadata.jsonld. 

### Added
- Scripts to migrate files on disk AWS S3.
  [CATS-1034](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1034)

### Changed
- Include collection prefix in path when saving to S3.
- Include length of file in `FileService` when saving the bytes to any backend service. This helps optimize S3 implementation.
- Upgraded sbt from 0.13.0 to 0.13.6 to fix build failures.
  [CATS-1038](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1038)

### Fixed
- Calling api/Files.removeFile should no longer decrement related counters twice.
  [CATS-929](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-929)

## 1.8.0 - 2019-11-06
**_Warning:_ This update adds a new permission for archiving files and adds it to the Admin role. Please make sure
to run Clowder with the `MONGOUPDATE` flag set to update the database.**

### Changed
- `/api/search` endpoint now returns JSON objects describing each result rather than just the ID. This endpoint has three
  new parameters - from, size, and page. The result JSON objects will also return pagination data such as next and 
  previous page if Elasticsearch plugin is enabled and these parameters are used.
- S3ByteStorageService now uses AWS TransferManager for saving bytes - uploads larger than ~1GB should now save more reliably.
- `/api/search` endpoint now returns JSON objects describing each result rather than just the ID.
- Clean up docker build. Use new buildkit to speed up builds. Store version/branch/git as environment variables in 
  docker image so that they can be inspected at runtime with Docker.
- Extractors are now in their own docker-compose file. Use Traefik for proxy. Use env file for setting options.
- Utilize bulk get methods for resources widely across the application, including checking permissions for many resources
  at once. Several instances where checks for resource existence were being done multiple times (e.g. in a method and then
  in another method the first one calls) to reduce MongoDB query load. These bulk requests will also report any missing
  IDs in the requested list so developers can handle those appropriately if needed.
- Removed mini icons for resource types on tiles.
  [CATS-1031](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1031)
- Cleaned up pages to list and enable extractors. Added description of what the page does. Added links to extraction info 
  pages. Removed authors from table. 

### Added
- Ability to pass runtime parameters to an extractor, with a UI form dynamically generated UI from extractor_info.json.
  [CATS-1019](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1019)
- Infinite scrolling on search return pages.
- Trigger archival process automatically based on when a file was last viewed/downloaded and the size of the file.
- Script to check if mongodb/rabbitmq is up and running, used by Kubernetes Helm chart.
- Queuing system that allows services such as Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ to store requested actions in MongoDB
  for handling asynchronously, allowing API calls to return as soon as the action is queued rather than waiting for
  the action to complete.
- New extractors monitor docker image to monitor extraction queues. Monitor app includes UI that shows selected 
  information about the extractors
- New `/api/thumbnails/:id` endpoint to download a thumbnail image from ID found in search results.
- New utility methods in services to retrieve multiple MongoDB resources in one query instead of iterating over a list.
- Support for MongoDB 3.6 and below. This required the removal of aggregators which can result in
  operations taking a little longer. This is needed to support Clowder as a Kubernetes Helm chart.
  [CATS-806](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-806)
- New Tree view as a tab in home page to navigate resources as a hiearchical tree (spaces, collections, datasets, 
  folders and files). The tree is lazily loaded using a new endpoint `api/tree/getChildrenOfNode`.

### Fixed
- Downloading metrics reports would fail due to timeout on large databases. Report CSVs are now streamed
  to the client as they are generated instead of being generated on the server and sent at the end.
- Social accounts would not properly be added to a space after accepting an email invite to join it.
- Fixed bug where extractors monitor will not print error, but just return 0 if queue is not found.
- Pagination controls are now vertically aligned and use unescaped ampersands.
- Changing the page size on dataset, collection, space listings would not properly update elements visible on the page.
  [CATS-1030](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1030)
- Added a max of 100 status messages on the  page listing all extractions. Before this trying to list all extractions in 
  the system was causing the JVM to run out of memory.
  [CATS-1032](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1032)
- Added padding to the top of the footer so that the superadmin notification does not cover buttons and the buttons
  at the end of forms are not too close to the footer and difficult to see.
  
## 1.7.4 - 2019-10-21
