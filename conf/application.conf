# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/), by providing a logger.xml file in the conf directory .

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# Where to store files on disk
files.path = /tmp/medici

# MongoDB
mongodb.default.db = "test"
# Optional values
#mongodb.default.host = "127.0.0.1"
#mongodb.default.port = 27017
#mongodb.default.user = "leon"
#mongodb.default.password = "123456"

# MongoURI
# ~~~~~
# a MongoURI can also be used http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connections

# WriteConcern
# ~~~~~
# Can be any of the following
#
# fsyncsafe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; Write operations wait for the server to flush data to disk.
# replicassafe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; waits for at least 2 servers for the write operation.
# safe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; waits on a server for the write operation.
# normal - Exceptions are raised for network issues but not server errors.

#mongodb.default.writeconcern = "safe"

# Replica sets
# ~~~~~
# http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Why+Replica+Sets
#
# To user a replicaset instead of a single host, omit optional values and use the configuration below instead.
# Since replica sets use public key authentication, user and password won't work together with the replicaset option.

#mongodb.default.replicaset {
#    host1.host = "10.0.0.1"
#
#    host2.host = "10.0.0.2"
#    host2.port = 27018
