Previewers
==========

Previewers are custom Javascript code to visualize information about datasets and files (collection support is
experimental). Usually those are used to provide a preview of a file, when the file is big, but they can be used to
visualize more interesting aspects of a resource. For example, the GIS previewers enable overlaying geospatial data
on a interactive map in the browser.

Previewer can work together with extractors and external services.
