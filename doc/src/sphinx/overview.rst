Let's get the ugly truth out of the way, why don't we?

What is it good for?
--------------------

* You want to have your web interface close to the data
* You want to customize how you preview, store, curate the data
* You have a lot of data but cannot afford cloud storage solutions

What is it bad for?
-------------------

* If you just want to store small files that don't require a lot of curation a cloud storage solution might be a better fit


The ugly?
---------

* It's research software, use at your own risk
* A 1.0 version has not been released yet
