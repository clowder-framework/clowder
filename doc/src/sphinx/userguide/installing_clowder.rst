Installing Clowder
##################

What type of user are you?
===================================


For **most users of Clowder**: :ref:`Get started here <usersOfClowder>` üëá

For **developers of Clowder itself**: :ref:`Dev quickstart here<clowderDevelopers>` üëá

-  Build Clowder from source via IntelliJ‚Äôs Play-2 run
   configuration.
-  Run the required services via Docker.

For **production instances of Clowder**, a Kubernetes deployment is recommended and manual installations are being phased out.

-  See `Clowder's Kubernetes install instructions here <https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder-helm>`__.
-  Otherwise, manually install Clowder, and each of it's required services (at a minimum: MongoDB,
   ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ). See :ref:`requirements below<requirements>` for details.

.. _usersOfClowder:

Users of Clowder: Getting Started via Docker
==============================================

1. Install `Docker Desktop <http://docker.com/>`__ (if you haven‚Äôt already)
2. Clone or download `Clowder on Github <https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder>`_ (use the default ``develop`` branch)

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder.git

3. Navigate to Clowder‚Äôs root directory in your bash command line (``cd clowder``)
4. Start Clowder using the Docker Compose configuration, via your command line

.. code:: bash

   docker-compose up -d
   
5. If you experience any issue with file uploads and see the below error message in the console:

.. code:: text

   [ERROR  ] - application - Could not create folder on disk /home/clowder/data/uploads/xx/xx/xx
   [ERROR  ] - application - Could not save bytes, deleting file xxx

you can try this command:

.. code:: bash 
   
   docker-compose exec -u 0 clowder chmod 777 /home/clowder/data

6. Open your web browser to ``localhost:8000``

-  If you see Error 404, allow a minute for it to appear.
-  Note: use port 8000 for docker run. However, port 9000 for manual builds.

‚≠ê If you experience *any* trouble, come ask us on `Slack here <https://join.slack.com/t/clowder-software/shared_invite/enQtMzQzOTg0Nzk3OTUzLTYwZDlkZDI0NGI4YmI0ZjE5MTZiYmZhZTIyNWE1YzM0NWMwMzIxODNhZTA1Y2E3MTQzOTg1YThiNzkwOWQwYWE>`_! ‚≠ê

.. dropdown:: Helpful docker commands
   :open:

   -  ``docker-compose¬†up¬†-d``¬†- start up all required services
   -  ``docker-compose¬†down``¬†- stop all docker containers
   -  ``docker-compose¬†logs¬†-f`` - see the logs
   -  ``docker ps`` - check how many services are running
   -  ``docker info`` - details about your docker version

      - After starting Docker, check that your services are running via the Docker Desktop GUI, or run ``docker ps`` and check that 3 containers are running. 
      - The "image" column should show ``rabbitmq``, ``elasticsearch`` and ``mongo``.


Clowder started! Now :ref:`create a new user üëá <easyUserCreation>`

.. _easyUserCreation:

Sign up for a Clowder login account
-------------------------------------

After installing Clowder, you still need to sign up for a user account. 

Run this in your terminal to create a new account:

.. code:: bash

   docker run --rm -ti --network clowder_clowder -e \
      FIRST_NAME=Admin -e LAST_NAME=User \
      -e EMAIL_ADDRESS=admin@example.com -e PASSWORD=catsarecute \
      -e ADMIN=true clowder/mongo-init

Optionally, edit these properties to your liking:

-  FIRST_NAME
-  LAST_NAME
-  EMAIL_ADDRESS
-  PASSWORD
- ADMIN (only set this if you want the user to have superadmin rights, make sure at lease one user has this).

‚úÖ Configuration complete! Now you can login to Clowder via ``localhost:9000`` in your browser.

.. warning::

   If you renamed the base clowder folder to something else, like `kitten`, then the ``--netowrk`` parameter must be changed to ``--network kitten_clowder``.

All done! You should be able to login to your new account, create new Spaces & Datasets and upload many different types of data.

.. _clowderDevelopers:

Clowder Developers: Getting Started
===================================

For **Clowder developers**, a hybrid is recommended:

-  Part 1: Run the required services via **Docker**, and expose each of
   their ports to Clowder.
-  Part 2: Run the Clowder instance manually via **IntelliJ Ultimate**‚Äôs Play-2 run
   configuration.

Part 1: Setup Docker
--------------------

1. Install `Docker <http://docker.com/>`__ (if you haven‚Äôt already)
2. Clone Clowder‚Äôs ``develop`` branch (the default)

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder.git

.. dropdown::  Apple Silicon M1 users, additional instructions here üíªüëà
   :open:

   Clowder works well on Apple Silicon, with only one minor caveat. No changes are necessary, but these optimizations are handy.

   Elasticsearch does not work and so the search bar in the top right 
   of the web interface will not work or be visible. Clowder depends on 
   an older version of Elasticsearch before it added Apple Silicon support, 
   and Docker's QEMU emulation of x64 happens to fail causing the container to infinitely crash 
   and restart.

   To prevent this container from constantly crashing and restarting, 
   please comment it out of the Docker definition in ``docker-compose.yml``. 

   .. code:: yaml

      # COMMENT THIS OUT in docker-compose.yml:

      # search index (optional, needed for search and sorting future) 
      elasticsearch:
        image: clowder/elasticsearch:${CLOWDER_VERSION:-latest}
        command: elasticsearch -Des.cluster.name="clowder"
        networks:
          - clowder
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          - cluster.name=clowder
        volumes:
          - elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

   Additionally, you may have to install Scala and SBT on your Mac.

   .. code:: bash

      brew install scala sbt

   Finally, there is *no need* to specify a 'default Docker platform, and could hurt performance. (i.e.  ``<DO NOT> export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64``.') Only the necessary Docker containers will automatically emulate x64, and the rest will run natively on Apple Silicon.


Expose Docker services‚Äô ports to Clowder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for Clowder to access the required services (at a minimum:
MongoDB, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ. See
`Requirements <https://clowder-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/installing.html#requirements>`__
for details.), we must tell Clowder which ports the services are using.

1. Create an override file, where we will store the port information

.. code:: bash

   # navigate to Clowder base directory
   cd clowder 
   # create new file docker-compose.override.yml 
   touch docker-compose.override.yml 

2. Copy and paste the lines below into that file we just created
   ``docker-compose.override.yml``

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Default

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :caption: docker-compose.override.yml

         # Enable Clowder to communicate with the necessary services (Mongo, RabbitMQ, ElsticSearch)
         # Each service runs as a Docker container.

         services:
         mongo:
            ports:
               - 27017:27017
         rabbitmq:
            ports:
               - 5672:5672
               - 15672:15672
         elasticsearch:
            image: elasticsearch:2
            ports:
               - 9200:9200
               - 9300:9300


   .. tab-item:: Apple Silicon M1

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :caption: docker-compose.override.yml

         # Enable Clowder to communicate with the necessary services (Mongo, RabbitMQ, ElsticSearch)
         # Each service runs as a Docker container.

         services:
         mongo:
            ports:
               - 27017:27017
         rabbitmq:
            ports:
               - 5672:5672
               - 15672:15672
         # Elasticsearch does NOT work with Apple Silicon M1. Do not include it here.
         # That's okay, but as a result the search bar will not be visible.
         # elasticsearch:
         # image: elasticsearch:2
         # ports:
         #    - 9200:9200
         #    - 9300:9300

3. Test that our services work! First start them:

.. code:: bash

   docker-compose up -d


.. note::
   By default, running ``docker-compose up -d`` uses the ``docker-compose.yml`` configuration **and will apply overrides found in** ``docker-compose.override.yml``. Neither file need to be specified on the command line.

.. dropdown:: (Optional) Check that the Docker containers are running
   
   You can see them in the Docker Desktop application, or in the web browser shown below.

   ``localhost:27017``
   - You should see: "It looks like you're trying to access MongoDB..." Success!
   ``localhost:15672``
   - You should see: the RabbitMQ login screen (no need to login tho!). Success!

    Now keep everything running, and next let‚Äôs build Clowder from source üëá


Part 2: Run Clowder via IntelliJ
--------------------------------

1. Install IntelliJ **Ultimate Edition**.

   - This guide will assume developers use IntelliJ. Ultimate Edition is required for the Play2 configuration.

2. Open the base Clowder directory & install Scala plugin

   - This should prompt you to install the Scala plugin! Install it.
   - Or, manually install the Scala Plugin for IntelliJ ``File`` --> ``Settings`` --> ``Plugins`` --> ``Download Scala``.
3. Install Java 8 (i.e. Java 1.8) on your computer. Clowder requires Java version 8 and is not compatible
   with other versions.

   - I find this easiest to do via IntelliJ‚Äôs Plugin Manager. ``File`` --> ``Project Structure`` --> ``SDKs`` --> ``+`` icon --> ``Download JDK``
   - Select ``Version 1.8`` (Clowder is only compatible with Java 8 (1.8), nothing higher) --> Vendor: ``Eclipse Temurin (AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot)`` --> ``Download``.

   - Alternatively, download the JDK online at `AdoptOpenJDK <https://adoptopenjdk.net/>`__. Java 8, HotSpot.
   - Then point IntelliJ to the JDK folder under ``Project Structure`` --> ``SDKs`` and specify the root folder of the JDK you just downloaded.

.. figure:: ../_static/IntelliJ_JDK_Download.png
   :alt: Download JDK from IntelliJ.

4. Add a new Run Configuration

   - In the top right, click the dropdown and click ‚ÄúEdit Configurations‚Ä¶‚Äù

.. figure:: ../_static/GettingStarted_addConfig.png
   :alt: Add new configuration

5. Create a new ``Play 2 App`` configuration

.. note::

   If you **don‚Äôt see Play 2 App in the list**, ensure you have the Scala plugin installed. If Play2 still isn't there, you may need to use IntelliJ *Ultimate* version (instead of Community). I experienced this bug, feel free to ask in the `Clowder Slack here <https://join.slack.com/t/clowder-software/shared_invite/enQtMzQzOTg0Nzk3OTUzLTYwZDlkZDI0NGI4YmI0ZjE5MTZiYmZhZTIyNWE1YzM0NWMwMzIxODNhZTA1Y2E3MTQzOTg1YThiNzkwOWQwYWE>`_.

.. figure:: ../_static/GettingStarted_Play2Config.png
   :alt: Create play2 configuration.

6. The default run configuration should be okay, see image below.

.. figure:: ../_static/GettingStarted_AddJDK.png
   :alt: Specify the JDK path in the Run Configuration.
   
   The default Clowder run Configuration.

.. note::

   Later, **if Clowder feels slow** (multiple seconds per page load) then you will need to add JNotify to your JVM Options on this page. :ref:`See the instructions at bottom of this page<slowClowder>`.


**‚≠êÔ∏è Now start Clowder:** In IntelliJ, click the green play button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (top right) to build Clowder from source! Give it a minute to finish. Access Clowder via ``localhost:9000`` in the browser.

Also note, a handy debugging mode is enabled by default. You can run the debug mode by clicking the green "bug" üêû button right beside the play button.

.. _creatingLocalAccount:

Creating a local Clowder account
--------------------------------

After installing Clowder, you still need to sign up for a user account. 

Run this in your terminal to create a new account:

.. code:: bash

   docker run --rm -ti --network clowder_clowder -e \
      FIRST_NAME=Admin -e LAST_NAME=User \
      -e EMAIL_ADDRESS=admin@example.com -e PASSWORD=catsarecute \
      -e ADMIN=true clowder/mongo-init

Optionally, edit these properties to your liking:

-  FIRST_NAME
-  LAST_NAME
-  EMAIL_ADDRESS
-  PASSWORD
-  ADMIN (only set this if you want the user to have superadmin rights, make sure at lease one user has this).

‚úÖ Configuration complete! Now you can login to Clowder via ``localhost:9000`` in your browser.

.. warning::

   If you renamed the base clowder folder to something else, like `kitten`, then the ``--netowrk`` parameter must be changed to ``--network kitten_clowder``.


:ref:`Skip to using default extractors and developer resources <defaultExtractors>` üëá

.. dropdown:: (Optional) User creation method 2: mock SMTP server

   **Enable local email verification**

   For local instances of Clowder, the email verification step will have to
   be done manually, via a mock SMTP email server.

   Add the following lines to the bottom of ``application.conf``:

   .. code:: bash

      # application.conf

      # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      # Local email verification -- see Intellij's run console to complete registration
      # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      smtp.mock=true

   All accounts must also be activated by an administrator. To activate
   your account by default, edit ``application.conf``:

   .. code:: bash

      # application.conf
      # Search for this line, and EDIT it (do not add a new line)
      # Set to false

      # Whether emails for new users registrations go through admins first
      registerThroughAdmins=false

   **Now, create a local Clowder account via the web interface**

   Start Clowder:

   1. Start required services (via
      ``docker-compose up -d`` from the root
      Clowder directory).

      1. You can check if your services are already running using
         ``docker ps`` and check that 3 containers are active (MongoDB,
         ElasticSearch, and RabbitMQ) by looking at
         ``Server ‚Üí Containser: 3``. Or check via the Docker Desktop GUI.

   2. Ensure your local clowder instance is running (on ``localhost:9000``)

   Finally, **attempt to signup for an account via the Clowder GUI** on
   ``localhost:9000``

   -  Click the Sign Up button in the top right.

   Upon clicking Signup, **the IntelliJ console will show the text of the
   user signup verification emails**, where you can click the confirmation
   link.

   Look for this in Intellij's run output terminal, **and click the link to complete registration**:

   .. code:: python

      <p>Please follow this
          <a href="http://localhost:9000/signup/baf28c54-80fe-480c-b1e4-9200668cb92e">link</a> to complete your registration
          at <a href="http://localhost:9000/">Clowder</a>.
      </p>

   -  Don‚Äôt see it? Make sure you enabled ``smtp.mock=true`` above.

   Now fill in your account details, and you should be good to go using
   Clowder!

.. dropdown:: (Optional) Edit user properties directly in MongoDB

   To edit the permissions on *existing accounts*, **edit their properties
   in MongoDB**. You can skip this step if you haven‚Äôt created a local Clowder
   account yet.

   1. Download a GUI for MongoDB: MongoDB Compass or a 3rd party tool like RoboMongo.
   2. Ensure all services are running!

   .. code:: bash

      cd clowder # base directory

      # start all required services 
      docker-compose up -d

   1. Connect RoboMongo to the docker instance (the defaults should be
      fine)

      1. Point it towards port ``27017``

   2. To find user properties, in the file tree on the left, navigate to clowder ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí
      social.users

      1. Then click the dropdown to expand that user
      2. Find ``status`` field, and right click to edit.
      3. If it is ``Inactive``, change it by typing ``Active``
         (capitalized).

   3. User is activated. Refresh your browser (on ``localhost:9000``) to access Clowder.
   

.. _slowClowder: 

If Clowder feels slow, add the faster JVM option
------------------------------------------------

- Follow the `instructions here to add JNotify <https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/CATS/JVM+Configuration+Options>`__.
- Simply download JNotify and tell IntelliJ where it is in the ``Run Configurations`` -> ``JVM Options``.

.. _defaultExtractors: 

Use the default extractors
============================


The default extractors offer simple quality of life improvements for image, video, pdf, and audio file previews while browsing Clowder. Extractors also offer powerful capabilities for manipulating your data in Clowder, see `PyClowder <https://github.com/clowder-framework/pyclowder>`__ for additional capabilities, including running machine learning training on your data stored in Clowder.

Enable the default Extractors:

.. code:: bash
   
   # start Clowder with extractor support
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.extractors.yml up -d

Or run NCSA GeoServer for viewing and editing geospacial data via ``docker-compose.geoserver.yml``: 

* geoserver
* ncsa_geo_shp
* extractor-geotiff-preview
* extractor-geotiff-metadata

.. code:: bash
   
   # start Clowder with default extractors, and GeoServer extractors
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.extractors.yml -f docker-compose.geoserver.yml up -d

Learn more about `GeoServer <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/NCSASoftware/GeoServer+Focus+Group+Final+Report>`__ and `read the documentation <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/MM/Documentation>`__.

Troubleshooting extractors
---------------------------
First, make sure you include the extractors when starting Docker! See ``docker-compose.extractors.yml`` in :ref:`the section above <_defaultExtractors>`. 

If running the extractor results in a ``"Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused"``, this is a Docker networking issue. Containers must be able to talk to each other (Clowder talking to RabbitMQ).

To resolve, open ``clowder/conf/application.conf`` search for and set the RabbitMQ message queue URL:

.. code:: yml

    clowder.rabbitmq.clowderurl="http://host.docker.internal:9000"

Simply saving the file should fix the issue. You can again "submit a file for extraction" on the file's details page. Done!

If navigating to ``localhost:9000`` yields nothing, try this. On Windows, I've had trouble getting ``localhost`` to resolve to the Docker host, so: 

- Access Clowder **not** via localhost, but **via your local IP address**. For example, ``55.251.130.193:9000``. 

- Find your local IP address:
   - Windows: ``Settings`` -> ``Network & internet`` -> ``IPv4 address``.
   - Mac: ``System Preferences`` --> ``Netowrk``--> ``Advanced``--> ``TCP/IP``--> ``IPv4 Address``. (Note: don't use the 'Public IP' from iStat Menus).
   - Linux ``$ ifconfig``

That should resolve extractor issues across all major platforms, including Apple Silicon (M1).
